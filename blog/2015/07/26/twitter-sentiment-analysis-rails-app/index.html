	<h2 class="title">On a Scale of Dalai Lama to Kanye West, How Narcissistic Are You? A Rails App That Lets You Find Out Just That.</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>For a small side project to be shared with our Flatiron School classmates and some <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Presents/">Flatiron School Presents Meetup</a> guests, my partner Mitch and I decided to build an app that measures people&rsquo;s narcissism levels via their Twitter feed. A linguistic analysis-baased social insights algorithm, if you will.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/kanye-meme.png"></p>

<p>(meme taken from <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/688363-kanye-west">here</a> &ndash; spoiler alert for celebrities' narcissism levels)</p>

<p>Much has been said and done and invested into when it comes to social media sentiment analysis in finance, with many financial institutions investing heavily in it. A cursory Google search offers up names of many start-ups involved in mining, mapping, analyzing, and plain having fun with Twitter. We figured that as tech professionals, working with social media and building a fun prototype for understanding the tools and the medium is a valuable experience.</p>

<p>Our original idea was parsing through people&rsquo;s Instagram feed to see how many posted photos were selfies for a better narcissism indicator, but considering advanced facial recognizition technology needed and the fact it was meant to be a small side project executed while carrying on a full school work load, we have settled on the twitter-based project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">Twitter gem</a> made working with Twitter a breeze, although there were limitations for how many posts could be parsed through at once and of course the max number of timeout requests every minute.</p>

<p>We designed everything through the use of good ol' Rails New NarcissismProject. We had one user model that we worked with.</p>

<p>The front page invites a user to check how narcissistic the are by entering a twitter handle (which will work whether or not prefixed with an @ to make user&rsquo;s life easier; we have also allowed for the first or last typed character to be blank space in case a user is very space-key-trigger-happy; other than that, the handle has to follow Twitter rules as ensured by a RegEx check):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/narcissism-app-front-page.png"></p>

<p>Once a user enters a twitter handle, it parses their feed for key narcissism-related words that we have pre-determined in the app; it then checks it against a scale of celebrities. It then returns user&rsquo;s score and their celebrity match (mine is Flatiron School&rsquo;s very own <a href="https://twitter.com/aviflombaum">Avi Flombaum</a>)</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t share the celbrity scale on the app, as it is more fun for the user to discover it him/herself. To built it, we have parsed through the top 100 most-followed twitter accounts (most of which are individual celebrities) and some more and scored them. We then picked some representatives for each scale gradation, throwing in a few Flatiron School-related Easter Eggs, just for fun. If this was a commercial product, we would have to update the celebrity scale just in case some of them go into narcissism rehab or new self-loving celebrities merger.</p>

<p>Most of our findings were unsurprising: Dalai Lama and the Pope were at the very bottom (with Dalai Lama being slightly less narcissistic and thus representing no. 1 on our scale); Kanye West was 9 out of 10 (beat only by the likes of Lena Dunham); Mr. West was closely followed by Kim Kardashian in the 8th place. To me, this means that are simplistic prototype algorithm actually works!</p>

<p>I stopped to pondered if it is unethical to make fun of people&rsquo;s narcissism levels, but considering the celeberities that came up on top and their interest in self-promotion, I figured out their high tankings it would be quite a compliment to them (I am really, really tempted to tweet Mr. West and ask him how he feels about being outdone by Ms Dunham).</p>

<p>What turned out to be incredibly fun was soliciting our friends' and classmates' twitter handles and checking their narcissism levels. A few were truly off-the-charts! (We even had to design more model logic for those cases) The top 10 narcissistic twitter handles are then saved separately and published on the Top 10 page &ndash; with many people I know outdoing our celebrities of choice. Uh oh.</p>

<p>A short demo video can be found <a href="http://youtu.be/T_tTweOvDqs">here</a> &ndash; YouTube link.</p>

<p>And here is a link to the Github <a href="https://github.com/mitchellhart/twitter_analyzer">repo</a>.</p>

<p>I will update this post once the app actually goes live as is our goal.</p>
