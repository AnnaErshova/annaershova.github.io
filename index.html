  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rails comes with a number of very convenient <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html">generators</a> that can take a lot of work out of creating models, controllers, views, tests, corresponding database migrations, etc.</p>

<p>Like many other developers, I use Rails scaffold generation as an efficient and convenient time-saver.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html">Guides</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A scaffold in Rails is a full set of model, database migration for that model, controller to manipulate it, views to view and manipulate the data, and a test suite for each of the above.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, you can generate all of those components individually as well, depending on your needs. But I think the scaffold generator in particular gets quite overused.</p>

<p>A regular scaffold Terminal command looks like this: <code>rails g scaffold Model_Name column_name:column_type:optional_index</code></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/scaffold_generate.png"></p>

<p><code>Model_Name</code> should be in singular, either under_scored or CamelCased.</p>

<p>Sometimes you hit the <code>return</code> button too soon, and deleting generated files by hand is just too much trouble.</p>

<p>There is a way to undo your entire scaffold: <code>rails d scaffold Generated_Scaffold_Name</code>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/scaffold_destroy.png"></p>

<p>(You can type out <code>generate</code> instead of <code>g</code> and <code>destroy</code> instead of <code>d</code>.)</p>

<p>Note that if you have already run <code>rake db:migrate</code> after generating your scaffold, the <code>destroy</code> command won&rsquo;t work. It will delete the files that the scaffold command has created, but it won&rsquo;t alter the schema and whatever alterations your migration has created will stay there. See my <a href="http://annaershova.github.io/blog/2015/10/15/rake-database-tasks/">previous post</a> on database-related rake commands to learn how to fix that (you will probably want <code>rake db:migrate:down</code> or <code>rake db:rollback</code>).</p>

<p>And assuming you do version control, to see if the <code>destroy</code> command left any files, run <code>git status</code> or <code>git diff</code>.</p>

<p>Realistically speaking, to create a scaffold that later needs to be edited (say, a new migration created etc &ndash; obviously a very common scenario) can cause more time-consuming bug-hunting than creating your MVC + other accoutrements from scratch.</p>

<p>To generate a scaffold with tests (default option) stops a developer from proper test-driven development practices: writing a failing test first, and then making it pass.</p>

<p>You can of course pass in an option to prevent tests from being generated when creating a scaffold. Run <code>rails generate scaffold -h</code> to see a list of options in your terminal:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/scaffold_options_1.png">
<img class="center" src="/images/scaffold_options_2.png"></p>

<p>The options above are for Rails 4.2.0 and might be quite different for your version of Rails.</p>

<p>You can see that the command comes with a variety of options that allow for reasonable flexibility. For instance, to skip generating a migration, you can pass in <code>--skip-migration</code>. To skip creating tests, pass in <code>--no-test-framework</code>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, once you know exactly what you are building to the extent that you end up passing in a lot of options, you don&rsquo;t really need generators anymore and can create files manually that fit your needs. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to use it for production. But if you are just learning Rails and experimenting with it, generators are very handy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are multiple db namespace rake tasks, which are very useful for a Rails developer.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t often see them covered in Rails tutorials as a task list, and it took me a while to figure out which commands I needed to use while developing.</p>

<p>Most beginner developers stick to <code>rake db:migrate</code>, <code>rake db:seed</code> and <code>rake db:reset</code>, but there are quite a few more options.</p>

<p><em>Migration</em> is a version of a database (I <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t understand what we are migrating and where, but oh well, such is conventional terminology).</p>

<p>Each new migration modifies a database schema (which starts out blank) by adding and removing data, changing data types etc.</p>

<p>Your schema is normally stored in  <code>db/schema.rb</code>, although for some developers, it will be in <code>db/structure.sql</code>.</p>

<p>(To create and use <code>structure.sql</code>, use <code>config.active_record.schema_format = :sql</code> in your <code>config/application.rb</code>. Most beginners should be sticking to schema.rb, the default version.)</p>

<p>First, some schema-related tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rake db:version</code> - to see your current schema version. Schemar versions are normally also listed as timestamps, so you will see something like <code>Current version: 20151014015045</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:forward</code> will push the schema one step up.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:schema:load</code> &ndash; loads she schema into your database. Good practice is using it when you first put your app in production; then run migrations from there on.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:schema:dump</code> &ndash; dumps she schema.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now back to migrations:</p>

<p>The easiest way to generate a migration is to run <code>rails g migration AddUseridToPosts user_id:integer</code>.</p>

<p>Once a migration has been generated, it will be listed in your <code>db/migrate</code> folder, usually with a format <code>datestamp_migration_name.rb</code>. Running <code>rails g</code> generates a timestamp prefix because that is the order that Rails uses to execute pending migrations.</p>

<p>If you are creating a migration manually or copying over from another file, you need to use any alphanumeric prefix (even if it&rsquo;s one 1,2, and 3) that allows Rails to run pending migrations in correct order; or use a manual datestamp if that&rsquo;s what your other migrations use.</p>

<p>The migration in the example above adds a new colume of <code>user_id</code>, which is a type <code>integer</code>, to a table named <code>Posts</code> &ndash; assumption here is that one user <code>has_many</code> posts and a post <code>belongs_to</code> user (if you don&rsquo;t know what that means, see <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html">Active Record Association Basics</a> ).</p>

<p>You can generate a migration to add a new table altogether, to remove a table or a column, to change a data type of a column, etc.</p>

<p>Even if the migration is in your migrate folder, it does not mean it is in the database schema yet. To incorporate it into the schema, you have any pending migrations into it. And that&rsquo;s when <code>rake db:migrate</code> task comes in.</p>

<p>Before I get started, see this <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake">rails source</a> to see the database.rake file that describes exactly what each task does.</p>

<p>Rake tasks undergo changes between different versions of Rails, so it&rsquo;s good to keep an eye out for anything that might be coming soon.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate</code> &ndash; runs the change or up method for all pending migrationsone by one in order indicated by name prefixes. If there are no such migrations, running the task won&rsquo;t produce any outcome. But when there are, it also executes <code>db:schema:dump</code> as it needs to dump the schema and build it anew considering the migration(s) that have been added.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate VERSION=version_number/timestamp</code> &ndash; runs specific migration to which the datestamp refers.</p></li>
<li><p>NB: <code>rake db:migrate VERSION=0&gt;</code> &ndash; roll back all migrations</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test</code> &ndash; runs migrations in an indicated envrionment.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You should be able to get timestamp as a prefix to a migration file name if you used a rails g command as explained above.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate:up</code> &ndash; runs up command for a given migration version (default is current version)</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate:down</code> &ndash; runs down command aka rolls back command for a given migration version</p></li>
</ul>


<p>NB: <code>Up</code> and <code>down</code> are actually old-school commands; <code>up</code> makes a change to the schema and <code>down</code> reverses the <code>up</code> change.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate:redo</code> &ndash; &ldquo;Rollbacks the database one migration and re migrate up (options: STEP=x, version_number/timestamp).&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate:redo STEP=x</code> = rolls back x many migrations and re-runs them</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate:rollback</code> &ndash; roll back last migration to get user back one step.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate:rollback STEP=x</code> &ndash; roll back x many steps</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now this is interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake db:migrate:reset</code> = <code>rake db:drop</code>+ <code>rake db:create</code> + <code>rake db:migrate</code> = undo and re-do migrations again for current environment. It does not rollback migrations.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note the difference from:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake db:reset</code> = <code>rake db:drop</code> + <code>rake db:setup</code></li>
</ul>


<p>where</p>

<p><code>rake db:setup</code> = <code>rake db:schema:load</code> OR <code>rake db:structure:load</code> + &lsquo;rake db:seed&rsquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(<code>rake db:schema:load</code> loads schema.rb into your database)</p></li>
<li><p>(<code>rake db:structure:load</code> loads db/structure.sql if you have specified that in your config)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Which means that <code>rake db:reset</code> drops database; recreates it from <code>db/schema.rb</code> or <code>db/structure.sql</code> in your current environment (and NOT from migrations); seeds database from <code>seeds.rb</code>.</p>

<p><em>Note that <code>rake db:migrate:reset</code> won&rsquo;t seed your database and <code>rake db:setup</code> will.</em></p>

<p>Another rake task is also useful to see where you are with regard to migrations:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake db:migrate:status</code> &ndash; display status of all migrations. It will alert you if there are no schema migrations in your project yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>And a heavy hitter:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake db:purge</code> &ndash; &ldquo;Empty the database from DATABASE_URL or config/database.yml for the current RAILS_ENV (use db:drop:all to drop all databases in the config). Without RAILS_ENV it defaults to purging the development and test databases.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>(The <code>rake db:purge</code> task was only added in January 2014 and is less known still.)</p>

<p>There is a great Rails Guide explaining a lot of these <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Remember to restart your rails server when working with these.</p>

<p>Should these tasks not meet your needs, you can always create a custom rake task to do exactly what you need.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started making my own rake tasks recently to help with specific repetitive tasks that I need to do while working on projects.</p>

<p>Rake is a project of Jim Weinrich; check out his rationale for making rake <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/files/doc/rational_rdoc.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite part is his explanation of why it is called rake. No, it has nothing to do with garden tools. It was supposed to be a portmanteau of &lsquo;ruby&rsquo; and &lsquo;make&rsquo; (since Rake was inspired by Makefile). Hence, rake.</p>

<p><em>rake -T</em> will give you a list of rake tasks available for a given project.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like for a standard octopress directory:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/take_t.png"></p>

<p>So if I forget that my normal routine is <code>rake generate</code> followed by <code>rake preview</code>, I can see it listed above.</p>

<p>I was working with the <a href="https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd">erd</a> gem, which uses <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> to visualize complex database relationships in rails. If you want to understand what exactly is happening in your schema, it&rsquo;s the gem for you.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t used it in a bit, so I googled it, and <a href="https://ryanboland.com/blog/creating-a-database-diagram-with-rails-erd/">this tutorial</a> popped up.</p>

<p>It had a suggestion to make a simple rake task to run the erd command with specific attributes to get just the type of a diagram you want:</p>

<pre><code class="``ruby desc 'Generate Entity Relationship Diagram'">  task :generate_erd do
    system "erd --inheritance --filetype=dot --direct --attributes=foreign_keys,content"
    system "dot -Tpng erd.dot &gt; erd.png"
    File.delete('erd.dot')
  end
</code></pre>

<p>The idea there is have a task that runs <code>erd --inheritance --filetype=dot --direct --attributes=foreign_keys,content</code>. The system then generated a .dot files, which is when converted into a .png file, with the rationale being that Graphviz has issues generating files that are not .dot.</p>

<p>You can just put it in a rake file, or run <code>rails g task erd generate_erd</code>. It adds a erd.rake file to lib/tasks (or you can add one manually and just type your code instead of using a generator).</p>

<p>To use that task, you type <code>rake erd:generate_erd</code> in your Terminal.</p>

<p>I ended up using these rake tasks to demonstrate the idea behind using namespace. They generate a png file as per an example above and a default pdf one:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rake_commands.png"></p>

<p>And running these tasks in Terminal:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rake_terminal.png"></p>

<p>And you are done! Two file types of database schema charts have been generated:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/erd_directory.png"></p>

<p>NB: if all you wanted was to simplify running one long command (such as the aforementioned <em>erd &ndash;inheritance &ndash;filetype=dot &ndash;direct &ndash;attributes=foreign_keys,content</em>), you could just create a shell alias that you could then use across all your projects if they have erd installed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While we are on a subject of controlling your Mac from your Terminal, here is something else that is useful:</p>

<p>Mac uptime is how long it has been since the system has been re-booted or re-started. Type in <em>uptime</em> in your Terminal, and you will see the stats in minutes, hours, or days, depending on how long it has been for your Mac:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/uptime.png"></p>

<p>(I just re-booted when installing a new OS X hence such a short uptime for me. Uptime can extend into months for some users as Macs tend to be very stable unlike Windows machines.)</p>

<p>You will also see number of users using your machine during said uptime as well as load averages in 1, 5, and 15 minute intervals from left to right &ndash; mine actually indicate I may want a more powerful system.</p>

<p>Type in <em>last reboot</em> to see rebooting history:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/lastreboot.png"></p>

<p>Another neat trick is to type in <em>last</em> to see last sessions of users, hosts and ttys in a reverse chronological order:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/last.png"></p>

<p>There are handy gadgets for uptime and reboot stats, but I doubt that most regular users would really need them on a regular basis. Checking in with your Terminal now and then should be sufficient.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am really used to seeing a pop up that says something along the lines of ‘a new version of OS X / iOS is available, do you want to update now?’</p>

<p>Upon some research on potential issues of an update in question (I learned the hard way after having my iPhone bricked post-update when living in China), I generally go back and click &lsquo;update.&rsquo; But there is actually an easy way to do it from your Terminal. All you need is a <em>softwareupdate</em> command.</p>

<p>Type in <em>man softwareupdate</em> to see this command&rsquo;s manual:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/softwareupdatemanual.png"></p>

<p>Run <em>softwareupdate -l</em> to see available updates. You will see something like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/softwareupdate_l.png"></p>

<p>While you are at it, you can turn on automatic update checker from your Terminal:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/softwareupdateautomaticcheck.png"></p>

<p>Then run this to install the specific update you want:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/supdinstall.png"></p>

<p>(Use -d flag to just download the update, but not install it.)</p>

<p>And of course to re-boot your computer, you can simply run this command instead of going through the Mac menu:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rails is constantly being updated and improved. Sometimes, the changes that have been announced are just too exciting to wait for an official release.</p>

<p>When I first read about ‘Edge Rails’, I was quite confused because it sounded like yet another JS library. Then when I was reading The Rails Way (Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Rails-Way-Obie-Fernandez/dp/0321445619">link</a> if you have somehow never heard of it), I realized I had been mistaken.</p>

<p>Grammatically speaking, it should be spelled <em>edge Rails</em>, as in lowercase <em>e</em>. But that is really between you and your text editor. In this context, ‘edge' just means the latest, cutting-edge version of Rails that has not been officially released yet.</p>

<p>Rails 5 looming upon us, but there is no official release date. I gather the best guess is late 2015 — early 2016. It does have some exciting features, such as merging of the rails-api gem / built-in support of the JSON APIs). So what do you do if you want to play around with that and don’t want to wait until the official release?</p>

<p>Ruby -v to see if you are using ruby 2.2.2+  as Rails 5 requires it. Use rvm to make sure you are running a suitable version.</p>

<p>The best instructions to install edge Rails can be found <a href="http://www.christopherbloom.com/2015/04/26/setting-up-a-rails-5-app-from-edge/">here</a> on Christopher Bloom&rsquo;s blog — they are straightforward and and I used them successfully, so I’d rather send you to the source than to copy-paste them here.</p>

<p>RailsGuides has an <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/">EdgeGuides</a> section specifically targeting the current master branch of the Rails repo.</p>

<p>Running edge Rails comes at a cost of potentially unstable dependencies. Having said that, it is not <em>that</em> unstable. Rails has a very extensive test coverage, which should help prevent regressions.</p>

<p>So do you want to run edge Rails? Probably not, unless you really plan to take advantage of groundbreaking unleashed feature or if you are particularly curious. But it’s nice to know it’s there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Behold &ndash; a real <a href="http://theweatherproject.herokuapp.com/">app</a>!</p>

<p>We used meteorological knowledge to convert weather forecasts into a &lsquo;real-life&rsquo; weather forecast. It takes into account humidity and wind speed for a variety of different scenarios to tell you what will it actually feel like outside in the next 36 hours. Some days, it will feel colder / cooler than what the weather forecasts say, and some days it will much hotter / warmer.</p>

<p>This was really fun to work on, and I really enjoyed making something useful &ndash; I have been using it every day to make sartorial choices and to figure out best time of the day to run outside.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&hellip;and we are officially in Project Mode here at the Flatiron School, working on project 1 of 2, which is meant to be a short project to be conceptualized, pitched, designed, built, and presented within a scope of 5 business days.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7fx6AknguzI">Here</a> is a very short video showcasing functionality that we have built in 2 days. We have deployed to Heroku since the video was made, which turned out to be much easier than expected, minus some fiddling with the Figaro gem.)</p>

<p>Primary goal right now is to make it aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>It looks fairly simple, but it actually features some pretty advanced weather-related logic. Who would have thought that energy trading background would come in handy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a small side project to be shared with our Flatiron School classmates and some <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Presents/">Flatiron School Presents Meetup</a> guests, my partner Mitch and I decided to build an app that measures people&rsquo;s narcissism levels via their Twitter feed. A linguistic analysis-baased social insights algorithm, if you will.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/kanye-meme.png"></p>

<p>(meme taken from <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/688363-kanye-west">here</a> &ndash; spoiler alert for celebrities' narcissism levels)</p>

<p>Much has been said and done and invested into when it comes to social media sentiment analysis in finance, with many financial institutions investing heavily in it. A cursory Google search offers up names of many start-ups involved in mining, mapping, analyzing, and plain having fun with Twitter. We figured that as tech professionals, working with social media and building a fun prototype for understanding the tools and the medium is a valuable experience.</p>

<p>Our original idea was parsing through people&rsquo;s Instagram feed to see how many posted photos were selfies for a better narcissism indicator, but considering advanced facial recognizition technology needed and the fact it was meant to be a small side project executed while carrying on a full school work load, we have settled on the twitter-based project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">Twitter gem</a> made working with Twitter a breeze, although there were limitations for how many posts could be parsed through at once and of course the max number of timeout requests every minute.</p>

<p>We designed everything through the use of good ol' Rails New NarcissismProject. We had one user model that we worked with.</p>

<p>The front page invites a user to check how narcissistic the are by entering a twitter handle (which will work whether or not prefixed with an @ to make user&rsquo;s life easier; we have also allowed for the first or last typed character to be blank space in case a user is very space-key-trigger-happy; other than that, the handle has to follow Twitter rules as ensured by a RegEx check):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/narcissism-app-front-page.png"></p>

<p>Once a user enters a twitter handle, it parses their feed for key narcissism-related words that we have pre-determined in the app; it then checks it against a scale of celebrities. It then returns user&rsquo;s score and their celebrity match (mine is Flatiron School&rsquo;s very own <a href="https://twitter.com/aviflombaum">Avi Flombaum</a>)</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t share the celbrity scale on the app, as it is more fun for the user to discover it him/herself. To built it, we have parsed through the top 100 most-followed twitter accounts (most of which are individual celebrities) and some more and scored them. We then picked some representatives for each scale gradation, throwing in a few Flatiron School-related Easter Eggs, just for fun. If this was a commercial product, we would have to update the celebrity scale just in case some of them go into narcissism rehab or new self-loving celebrities merger.</p>

<p>Most of our findings were unsurprising: Dalai Lama and the Pope were at the very bottom (with Dalai Lama being slightly less narcissistic and thus representing no. 1 on our scale); Kanye West was 9 out of 10 (beat only by the likes of Lena Dunham); Mr. West was closely followed by Kim Kardashian in the 8th place. To me, this means that are simplistic prototype algorithm actually works!</p>

<p>I stopped to pondered if it is unethical to make fun of people&rsquo;s narcissism levels, but considering the celeberities that came up on top and their interest in self-promotion, I figured out their high tankings it would be quite a compliment to them (I am really, really tempted to tweet Mr. West and ask him how he feels about being outdone by Ms Dunham).</p>

<p>What turned out to be incredibly fun was soliciting our friends' and classmates' twitter handles and checking their narcissism levels. A few were truly off-the-charts! (We even had to design more model logic for those cases) The top 10 narcissistic twitter handles are then saved separately and published on the Top 10 page &ndash; with many people I know outdoing our celebrities of choice. Uh oh.</p>

<p>A short demo video can be found <a href="http://youtu.be/T_tTweOvDqs">here</a> &ndash; YouTube link.</p>

<p>And here is a link to the Github <a href="https://github.com/mitchellhart/twitter_analyzer">repo</a>.</p>

<p>I will update this post once the app actually goes live as is our goal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a problem that I recently stumbled upon while researching something completely different, as these things usually go, &ndash; and down the rabbit hole I went.</p>

<p>How does one rotate a matrix?</p>

<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s define parameters of the exercise. We will take a matrix &ndash; an array of arrays &ndash; and turn it 90&deg; clockwise.</p>

<p>So this is what it would look like, using Flatiron&rsquo;s whiteboard table tops (we are really a paper-free school):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/matrix-rotation-example.png"></p>

<p>As you can see, numbers 1 (position[0][0] in zero-indexed terms) and 9 (position [2][2]) traded places. One thing is immediately obvious: this would only work if the matrix in question is &lsquo;square&rsquo;: that is, if there are x many rows with x many elements each.</p>

<p>Now that we have defined that condition, let&rsquo;s start with a simple 3x3 matrix.</p>

<p>If the original array looks like this, Ruby-style:</p>

<blockquote><p>my_array = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]</p></blockquote>

<p>The modified array would look like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>rotated_array = [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]</p></blockquote>

<p>But how to get there?</p>

<p>Ruby actually comes with default methods that allow one to manipulate arrays. Most people know <em>pop</em>, <em>shift</em>, <em>unshift</em>, and <em>drop</em>, but there are way more useful methods.</p>

<p>I was only marginally familiar with <em>rotate</em>, so here is an example:</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Array.html#method-i-rotate">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Returns a new array by rotating self so that the element at count is the first element of the new array.</p></blockquote>

<p>When using it without an argument (or rather with the default count of 1), it works like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rotate_simple_example.png"></p>

<p>It effectively takes the first part of the array and places it at the end of the array. If we use that 5 times on the array with 5 elements, we will arrive at the original array (well, it will return what looks like the original array as the original array does not get modified).</p>

<p>If used with a count that is not 1, it will move the elements down by the count number of places:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rotate_example_with_count2.png"></p>

<p>(array.rotate(2) is the same as <em>array.rotate.rotate</em>)</p>

<p>Count can also be negative, in which case it will rotate the array in the opposite direction, taking items from the end of the array and placing them in the front:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rotate-example-count-negative.png"></p>

<p>As many other methods, it can be used with the bang to modify the original array: <em>return!</em></p>

<p>I played around with <em>rotate</em>, and it became clear that I was going to need something else to complete the task:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rotate-example.png"></p>

<p>It handily re-arranged the nested components in the array, moving each &lsquo;inner&rsquo; array over by 1 at a time.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://apidock.com/ruby/Array/transpose">transpose</a>. It is actually a bit trickier to comprehend:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/transpose-simple-example.png"></p>

<p>For a nested array that contains 2 array of 2 elements each, it seems like all it does is switch elements that are in the [1][0] and [0][1] position with each other &ndash; in case below, only 2 and 3 traded places. But what is actually does, as becomes more obvious in case of a larger array (nexted with 3 arrays of 3 elements each) is make columns rows and rows columns.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/transpose-example.png"></p>

<p>Unlike <em>rotate</em>, <em>transpose</em> does not take any arguments.</p>

<p>By the way, although I won&rsquo;t be using it here, one of my favorite array methods is also <em>flatten</em>, which is a handy way to get nesting out of arrays:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/flatten-example.png"></p>

<p>As an aside, <em>flatten</em> is is also a handy way of converting a hash into a simple array:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/hash-flatten-example.png"></p>

<p>But back to the task at hand:</p>

<p>Upon experimenting with <em>rotate</em>, <em>flatten</em>, and <em>transpose</em>, I think I came up with a pretty efficient technique using <em>transpose</em> and then <em>reverse</em>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rotation-execution-example.png"></p>

<p>The array is first transposed and then iterated over, and each of the nexted arrays inside it is reversed.</p>

<p>Works like a charm. But if you want to do something slightly more exciting:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the origin array again:</p>

<blockquote><p>my_array = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]</p></blockquote>

<p>And at the rotated_array:</p>

<blockquote><p>rotated_array = [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]</p></blockquote>

<p>For a zero-indexed language, the nested array will look like this, positions-wise:</p>

<p>[6,3,0]<br>
[7,4,1]<br>
[8,5,2]<br></p>

<p>OR:</p>

<p>(position of first element (0 in this case) + 2*3) + (position of first element + 3*1 ) + (position of first element + 3*0)
(position of second element + 2*3) + (position of first element + 3*1 ) + (position of second element + 3*0)
(position of third element + 2*3) + (position of third element + 3*1 ) + (position of third element + 3*0)</p>

<p>Or for a nested array:</p>

<p>[[2][0],[1][0],[0][0]],<br>
[[2][1],[1][1],[0][1]],<br>
[[2][2],[1][2],[0][2]]<br></p>

<p>Which is:</p>

<p>[[my_array.length-1][my_array.length-3],[my_array.length-2][my_array.length-3],[my_array.length-3][my_array.length-3]],<br>
[[my_array.length-1][my_array.length-2],[my_array.length-2][my_array.length-2],[my_array.length-3][my_array.length-2]],<br>
[[my_array.length-1][my_array.length-1],[my_array.length-2][my_array.length-1],[my_array.length-3][my_array.length-1]]<br></p>

<p>This would be a cool structure to use if pushing things into the array (I am using absolute positions instead of array.length-related as it is easier in this example):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/pushing-into-rotated-array.png"></p>

<p>(as you can see I made a typo and then fixed it)</p>

<p>All you need to do thereafter is convert it into a nested array.</p>

<p>You can also do a chain of push statements:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/push-chain.png"></p>

<p>All of these are pretty fun solutions to the problem.</p>
