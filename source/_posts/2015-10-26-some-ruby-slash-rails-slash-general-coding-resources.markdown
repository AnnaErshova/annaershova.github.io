I keep getting asked what my favorite coding resources are, Rails or otherwise, so this is an attempt at keeping a running list, in no particular order. I fully intend to come back and edit this post as I stumbple upon new resources.

There are a lot of really great blogs from people writing Rails, and sometimes when googling something, I see amazingly written posts on fairly esoteric subjects. The resources below tend to be consistently good and conventional -- and enough to keep new developers occupied for a long, long time.

======

**Rails newsletters:**

* [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) -- one email every Thursday.

* [Green Ruby](http://greenruby.org/) -- one email every Sunday.

They have a lot of overlap, but since they come out on different days, sometimes it's nice to see a reminder that I meant to read an article or explore a new gem.

======

**Resources:**

* [Practicing Ruby](https://practicingruby.com/) -- well worth the $8/month they suggest paying.

* [Ruby Tapas](http://www.rubytapas.com/) -- also well worth the $9/month subscription fee.

* [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/)

* [http://railscasts.com/](http://railscasts.com/) -- amazing, well worth the subscription fee, although older poscasts are all free.

======

**General Resources:**

* [CoderCareer](http://codercareer.blogspot.com/) -- not Ruby/Rails-specific, but lots of cool content discussing coding interview questions and how to answer them. Gets updated very rarely though.

* [Ignita](https://www.igvita.com/) -- also rarely updated, also lots of cool content.

* [A Tornado of Razorblades]((http://adam.herokuapp.com/) by Adam Wiggins, a founder of Heroku.  -- also rarely updated, also pretty cool.

======

**Blogs:**

* [Justin Weiss](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/archives/). Updated less often than many people would like, but still an amazing read.

* [Thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/tags/rails) blog. Those are the guys behind [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) and [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) and many, many other projects. Enough said.

* [Official Rails Weblog](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/) -- great way to get a gist on what is happening in Rails.

* [Ruby on Rails subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails) -- not the best daily read, and it's too easy to get distracted by the cat memes in other subreddits, but cool to check out once in a while.

* [RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com/) -- community-sourced. Content varies from "what's new in Rails 5" to discussing very technical subjects.

* [RubyInside](http://www.rubyinside.com/) -- archive of some cool reads.

* [Blog by Arkency](http://blog.arkency.com/), a dev shop. These guys know what they are talking about.
