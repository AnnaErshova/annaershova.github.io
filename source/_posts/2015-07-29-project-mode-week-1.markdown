...and we are officially in Project Mode here at the Flatiron School, working on project 1 of 2, which is meant to be a short project to be conceptualized, pitched, designed, built, and presented within a scope of 5 business days.

[Here](https://youtu.be/7fx6AknguzI) is a very short video showcasing functionality that we have built in 2 days. We have deployed to Heroku since the video was made, which turned out to be much easier than expected, minus some fiddling with the Figaro gem.)

Primary goal right now is to make it aesthetically pleasing. 

It looks fairly simple, but it actually features some pretty advanced weather-related logic. Who would have thought that energy trading background would come in handy.
