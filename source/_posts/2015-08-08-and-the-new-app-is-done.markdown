Behold -- a real [app](http://theweatherproject.herokuapp.com/)!

We used meteorological knowledge to convert weather forecasts into a 'real-life' weather forecast. It takes into account humidity and wind speed for a variety of different scenarios to tell you what will it actually feel like outside in the next 36 hours. Some days, it will feel colder / cooler than what the weather forecasts say, and some days it will much hotter / warmer.

This was really fun to work on, and I really enjoyed making something useful -- I have been using it every day to make sartorial choices and to figure out best time of the day to run outside.

And it's sassy.
